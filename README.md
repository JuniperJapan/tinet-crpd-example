## Introduction

[TINET](https://github.com/tinynetwork/tinet) is a useful tool for setup virtual network topology using docker containers.

[cRPD](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/routers/containerized-routing-protocol-daemon-crpd.html) is an instance of the Junos OS routing functionality instantiated inside a Linux containerized environment. cRPD provides cloud-native routing to the network. We package the cRPD software as a Docker container image.

This repository contains example topology configurations for use cRPD on TINET.
